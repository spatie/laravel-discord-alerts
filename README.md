This package can quickly send alerts to Discord. You can use this to notify yourself of any noteworthy events happening in your app. 

Want to quickly send alerts to Slack? Then check out [laravel-slack-alerts](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-slack-alerts).

```php
use Spatie\DiscordAlerts\Facades\DiscordAlert;

DiscordAlert::message("You have a new subscriber to the {$newsletter->name} newsletter!");
```

Under the hood, a job is used to communicate with Discord. This prevents your app from failing in case Discord is down.

We invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source). You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard ``wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-discord-alerts
```

You can set a `DISCORD_ALERT_WEBHOOK` env variable containing a valid Discord webhook URL. You can learn how to get a webhook URL [in the Discord API docs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).


Alternatively, you can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="discord-alerts-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
<?php

return [
    /*
     * The webhook URLs that we'll use to send a message to Discord.
     */
    'webhook_urls' => [
        'default' => env('DISCORD_ALERT_WEBHOOK'),
    ],

    /*
     * Default avatar is an empty string '' which means it will not be included in the payload.
     * You can add multiple custom avatars and then specify directly with withAvatar()
     */
    'avatar_urls' => [
        'default' => '',
    ],

    /*
     * This job will send the message to Discord. You can extend this
     * job to set timeouts, retries, etc...
     */
    'job' => Spatie\DiscordAlerts\Jobs\SendToDiscordChannelJob::class,

    /*
    * The queue name that should be used to send the alert. Only supported for drivers
    * that allow multiple queues (e.g., redis, database, beanstalkd). Ignored for sync and null drivers.
    */
    'queue' => env('DISCORD_ALERT_QUEUE', 'default'),
];

```

## Usage

To send a message to Discord, simply call `DiscordAlert::message()` and pass it any message you want.

```php
DiscordAlert::message("You have a new subscriber to the {$newsletter->name} newsletter!");
```

## Sending an embed

To send an embed you can call the same function as above. Just add the embed as a second array as following:

```php
DiscordAlert::message("You have a new subscriber to the {$newsletter->name} newsletter!", [
    [
        'title' => 'My title',
        'description' => 'My description',
        'color' => '#E77625',
        'author' => [
            'name' => 'Spatie',
            'url' => 'https://spatie.be/'
        ]    
    ]
]);
```

You can also send multiple embeds as one message. Just be careful that you don't hit the limit of Discord.

## Changing webhook username/avatar/tts

Add/change the functions before invoking the message. `DiscordAlert::message()`
tts is false by default. You can add multiple custom avatars in the config file (same as multiple webhooks).

```php
DiscordAlert::withUsername('Test')->enableTTS('true')->withAvatar('custom')->message("You have a new subscriber to the {$newsletter->name} newsletter!");
```

## Using multiple webhooks

You can also use an alternative webhook, by specify extra ones in the config file.

```php
// in config/discord-alerts.php

'webhook_urls' => [
    'default' => 'https://hooks.discord.com/services/XXXXXX',
    'marketing' => 'https://hooks.discord.com/services/YYYYYY',
],
```

The webhook to be used can be chosen using the `to` function.

```php
use Spatie\DiscordAlerts\Facades\DiscordAlert;

DiscordAlert::to('marketing')->message("You have a new subscriber to the {$newsletter->name} newsletter!");
```

### Using a custom webhooks

The `to` function also supports custom webhook urls.

```php
use Spatie\DiscordAlerts\Facades\DiscordAlert;

DiscordAlert::to('https://custom-url.com')->message("You have a new subscriber to the {$newsletter->name} newsletter!");
```

### Using the delay feature

The `delayMinutes` of the `delayHours` function can be used to delay the message to Discord and can be used in parallel.

```php
use Spatie\DiscordAlerts\Facades\DiscordAlert;

DiscordAlert::to('https://custom-url.com')->delayMinutes(5)->message("You have a new subscriber to the {$newsletter->name} newsletter!");
DiscordAlert::to('https://custom-url.com')->delayHours(1)->message("You have a new subscriber to the {$newsletter->name} newsletter!");

DiscordAlert::to('https://custom-url.com')->delayHours(1)->delayMinutes(10)->message("You have a new subscriber to the {$newsletter->name} newsletter!");
```

## Formatting

### Markdown
You can format your messages with markup. Learn how [in the Discord API docs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-).

```php
use Spatie\DiscordAlerts\Facades\DiscordAlert;

DiscordAlert::message("A message **with some bold statements** and _some italicized text_.");
```

### Emoji's

You can use the same emoji codes as in Discord. This means custom emoji's are also supported.
```php
use Spatie\DiscordAlerts\Facades\DiscordAlert;

DiscordAlert::message(":smile: :custom-code:");
```
